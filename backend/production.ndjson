A software engineer can be self taught and learn everything for free practically except if there are some paid courses that you absolutely need to purchase.

Other professionals such as a farmer, can learn things online and look up information about a certain pesticide or unknown plant. The internet is such a big place and you can learn so much with all the resources available 24/7. So, why do people go to college? According to snhu.edu, it states that going to college and graduating gives you satisfaction, and it can improve with stability, earn more on average, less likely to lose their job, and improve your happiness.

Steve Jobs started in his garage, and became a huge hit with the Macintosh (ie. Mac). Mark Zuckenburg started Facebook, and most of the elderly use it to show their life to the world and share memories. Another con of going to college is having a lot of student debt. Student debt is something that a lot of people face and cannot finish paying off until when they reach their 30's. In a jubilee video that discussed this topic, most of the participants state that they went because they were forced or wanted to make their parents proud. They also said that they didn't know what to do in life after college because they did not have that planned out or wanted to change their career. This can lead to more student debt. In an article by northeastern college, they say that hard work and determination is way different than just having a degree. Most people would agree that if you do not apply what you have learned, accomplishing a goal would be difficult. According to the video, the teens state that copying exactly from a professor will not help you succeed because you are not using a certain skillet or using what he/she is teaching you. People need proper experience in the workforce because working and learning is super different and people are going to use what you learned at the place where you work at forever and you get to apply it whenever you need it. So, if a student need college or not, it depends on how and on what a student are planning to use the college education for. In conclusion, students don't need to have a college degree to be successful. People just have to dedicate their time and effort to do whatever they want to do in life."}]},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[],"style":"h1","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Summary"}]},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[],"style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Having a college degree does not mean that students are going to be successful in life or have an automatic ticket to a job.

Social media is used by nearly 225.61 million US citizens a day according to statistita.com. In other parts of the world there is a total of 3.78 billion users according to oberlo.com. Social media is a method that expanded our generation to new lengths in terms of how we share and receive information. For example, when Facebook was released, it was just a communication place for Zuckerberg and his fellows at Harvard. You can learn more by clicking here. The intention was never to become a huge company but a way of communication. Alongside Instagram, its primary purpose was to become a photography application. But now these two primary sources of today's generation is how we see what other's are doing and can see events from a long distance and even dance to music directly. A new Chinese app called \"TikTok\" or originally \"Musically\" is a dancing to music platform. What does that mean, people record themselves in a 10-30 second time frame dancing or lip syncing to a specific sound or music. This app has made so many people addicted and has made people go viral for simple dances. For example, the famous TikTok star, \"Charli D'amelio\" has over 100 million followers for her dances. One of them being the renegade created by Jalaiah Harmon, a 14 year old from Atlanta Georgia. This dance has become the most danced movement from 2019-2020. TikTok and its competitor Instagram with Instagram Reels, also get content other than dances, people also post funny videos, life hacks, food hacks, and other entertaining pieces. This generation has made people viral with social media. One of the main reasons it mostly happens in these platforms except for Facebook is because teens have the ideology that Facebook is for elderly people, so they don't use that platform. Another popular app, SnapChat, is mostly for chatting and using funny filters that change your appearance or can change your voice. Platforms like these are all serving one purpose, influence users to publish content. Social media has a huge impact on a teen's life because of its use of communication and entertainment. The best thing about it, it's all FREE. No charges for using the app, but of course the company gets money for the amount of users on the platform. Social media recently has been used by current President Trump on the app Twitter for encouraging the riot of the capitol. As we all know President Trump has \"tweeted\" a lot of false information and accusations on Twitter, as stated in various CNN interviews. This has led to people having riots such as the one that happened in the capital hill and protests such as the one that we all have heard of, Voter Fraud. As a result to the controversy, Facebook and Instagram decided to delete his account and ban him from his accounts.

After first period, students go to a 40-minute research period, where students can collaborate with your peers on homework and clubs. This time, is also to receive extra help from teachers. After research, it is either lunch or 2nd period. \"Lunch A\", students will go to lunch first and then report to second period. On the other hand, \"Lunch B\" students must go to second period first, and then report to lunch after. NeoCity has provided a helpful here. Lastly, students will transition to third period, which is the last 90-minute learning block of the day. On “B” days which are Tuesdays and Fridays, it's the exact same thing, but with periods 4,5, and 6. Then on Wednesday, NeoCity Knights have all six classes and no research or flex.

The longer you put off something, the less motivation you will have to do it. On top of that, the work eventually piles up for each class, which is why it's best to get it done as soon as possible (and you will have more free time). Another piece of advice is to always check Canvas. Canvas is where every single one of your assignments are at. You can use either the list or calendar view to see your upcoming assignments and due dates. Always check this to plan out when you will do which assignment and to keep track of those due dates. Also, make sure to always check Outlook and Microsoft Teams, especially if you're doing digital learning. This is how teachers will communicate with you if there are any problems or updates. If you have any questions, you can also email the teacher. Speaking of teachers, our teachers are amazing. If you're having any trouble, let them know and they will walk you through it!

One of the main reasons that this happened was due to the point that immigrants could have a right to education and get an education without having to pay.

This year was, however, different. The students were greeted with a new grading system upon returning to school. In a frightening turn, the new system resulted in many students not having any grades in Focus until the last two weeks of the quarter. In the past, many students regularly turned to Focus for a precise look at their grade point average. The pressure of a new school year, the uncertainty of a global pandemic, and the inability to control the future of a country on the rocks."}]},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[],"style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"If we focus on what the system is, purely in words and what it can be, its great! Being a school that is so focused on learning, the system will let students understand individual standards and get a better understanding on the struggles they have and what they need to do to improve themselves. The best description of what the grading system can be, was given in a statement by the school principal, Mr. Meechin. “SBG is a research-based approach to grading and assessment. It keeps student learning front and center in the process of assessment. SBG focuses on giving student feedback to get them to proficiency on an outcome (standard). Too often, students focus on, “is this for a grade?” As opposed to “did I learn what my teacher thought was important for me to learn?” Although this system has potential to benefit the school, it raises certain questions. Is the system having the effects hoped for?"}]},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[],"style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Mr. Meechin also says, “our staff is focused on having an impact to the educational system.” It is true that Neo is ahead of the curve when it comes to its students, but that doesn’t mean Neo is perfect. There are bound to be hiccups. Even if COVID-19 was not currently happening, would the school have had a smooth transition with the new system? One student interviewed said, “I personally don't think the grading system itself is bad, it's just the way the teachers are handling it. Some teachers like Dr. Rollins and Ms. Strang have been very helpful with using the system the way the school described. Those teachers put each assignment into its respective standard and taking the highest grade for that standard. However, some teachers only use specific assignments and tend to leave vague standards. So, students are confused when they receive a 1 or 2 on an assignment they thought they did well on”. And where do digital kids fall in this new spectrum of unknowns?"}]},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[],"style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Not to mention, it can't be good that many teachers are having trouble understanding the technology handed to them. This barrier only pulls away from the learning experience, causing instructors to mainly focus on the Face to Face students. What happens when a student has difficulty logging in or cannot understand the material? As a solution, many staff members will recommend going to teachers for Research or Flex. However, looking at the solution from afar, does it make sense? How can a teacher be expected to teach an entire lesson in half the time? In the beginning of the year there was a “break’ where teachers were brought back to be taught the new rules of the COVID based environment, technological aspects of their new job, and the new grading scale. Just like the kids at Neo, the teachers can also be overwhelmed. Students have all seen multiple teachers struggle with the transition of being completely F2F (Face-To-Face) to now having a mesh of F2F and digital. Since instructors must juggle ten new things with only two hands, was throwing in a new system too?"}]},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[],"style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"The new grading system is a great idea on paper, as previously stated. The concept of a more focused and cleaner idea of grading work is great, but does it work? Yes, the school's average grade has risen but at what cost. Students are facing more anxiety than ever; many students are struggling for a good grade and feels as though learning is more difficult. Another student interviewed said “Online school is extremely draining, despite the fact that students are only supposed to be on screens no more than 2 hours a day. At this point I'm more focused on turning in assignments rather than learning”. Eventually however, this will smooth over and the students of NeoCity will get a handle on the new system, along with its advantages. In the words of the wise Michael Meechin, “As with any system – we will hit roadblocks along the way, we will learn and refine, we will reflect on the process”."}]}]}

Way back when Instagram was a young and fresh app, Selena Gomez was taking the stage with her whopping 217 million followers. With that comes a lot of power, with a fanbase that passes the population of Russia, if Selena made a claim or said something online, those hundreds of millions of people would follow her lead. Such examples would include presidential votes. If a celeb posted on their media of choice about how they voted for candidate an instead of candidate b, all of those followers, hungry for attention and recognition would choose similarly. In an article posted in June of 2014 by Valerie R O’Regan titled, “The Celebrity Influence: Do people really care what they think?”, the article talks about the major influence on the general population when exposed to a celebrity's opinion. An excerpt of the article is as follows “Celebrity opinions and endorsements of political candidates, issues and office holders have now become commonplace in the media before and between elections. Many actors and comedians, athletes and talk-show hosts share their opinions with society in an attempt to influence the opinions of those who listen to them. Often these celebrities use their influence to persuade citizens to vote a certain way or advocate for certain issues such as reproductive freedom, environmental protection and human rights. This study examines young adults’ perceptions about celebrities’ political opinions and endorsements. The research finds that young adults are more likely to listen to individuals other than celebrities for their own political information. However, they do believe that celebrities have an effect on the way people think. The study also finds that the gender and ethnicity of the respondents affect their attitudes regarding celebrity endorsements.” This article shows that modern influencers, paired with modern opinions - with the help of new websites and apps that allow them to share these opinions accordingly - celebrities can essentially change the world."}]},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[],"style":"h1","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"How Is This Being Used In Real Life?"}]},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[],"style":"h2","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"And Why?"}]},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[],"style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Popular news and online reporter Daniel “Killer Keemstar” Keem has mentioned this in some recent videos, where certain youtube and twitch celebrities are using their influence on others to sway public opinion.

A good marketing decision could be getting social media personalities who are trusted in the public eye to do taste tests as a way to enhance their credibility."}]},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[],"style":"h2","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Nutrition Concerns"}]},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[{"_key":"bf02a3c02598","_type":"link","href":"http://www.redefinemeat.com/"}],"style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"No matter how close it is to meat, it also needs to be as healthy.

I think this is a great business model as people will never abandon real meat as its engrained in almost every food. It also talked about many places around the world serving their meat 10 years from now as a goal. Although Redefine Meat hasn’t set its sights in America it has launched New-Meat in many places like France and Europe to seemingly good success.
