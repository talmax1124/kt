Welcome to NeoCity Academy! If you're new here, my name is Yama and I'd like to welcome you to your news school. I've attended this school since freshman year and I'm currently a junior this year. I'm excited for you guys to join us! I know that this year is different with the COVID-19 pandemic going on, but don't worry, we at NeoCity Academy will make sure everything goes well for the new school year. At this point, you have all chosen to either learn at home or learn face-to-face. Whichever it may be, I'm here to inform you all about our unique schedule, various clubs, volunteering and tips. By the time you finish this, you will feel right at home!

# NeoCity Schedule

Let’s start with the schedule. You probably already know this, but Neo's schedule is based on a block schedule. In other words, there are three classes each day, and all six classes on Wednesdays. On “A” days which are Mondays and Thursdays, there is a 30-minute block time for students to spend on either flex, advisory, or deep dives. We will get into more detail about this later. Then students transition to 1st period which is 90 minutes of learning with that teacher. After first period, students go to a 40-minute research period, where students can collaborate with your peers on homework and clubs. This time, is also to receive extra help from teachers. After research, it is either lunch or 2nd period. "Lunch A", students will go to lunch first and then report to second period. On the other hand, "Lunch B" students must go to second period first, and then report to lunch after. NeoCity has provided a helpful here. Lastly, students will transition to third period, which is the last 90-minute learning block of the day. On “B” days which are Tuesdays and Fridays, it's the exact same thing, but with periods 4,5, and 6. Then on Wednesday, NeoCity Knights have all six classes and no research or flex. As for lunch, they will still have either "Lunch A" or "Lunch B", but instead of it being after/before second period, it will be before or after fifth period. Once again, it is possible to find your Lunch schedule through the helpful tool created by NeoCity.

# Flex, Advisory, and Deep Dives

As mentioned above, there is a 30-minute block time in the morning. On Mondays, it is "Flex" which means that students can spend this time however they'd like. Whether it is finishing up an assignment or working with peers on a project, it's up to the individual. On Tuesdays,,9th/10th graders will attend "Advisory" by reporting to their homeroom. There is no Flex or Research on Wednesdays. Then on Thursdays, students in grade 11 will attend their "Advisory." Lastly, Fridays are reserved for "Flex + Deep dives" where knights can choose an interest to pursue for the quarter. Teachers will teach a topic that can help knights in the future with a variety of topics. Topics could be academic or non-academic: painting, creative writing, building robots, making paper flowers, mystery puzzles, mind and body, etc. Try to book spots as soon as possible with friends, because they fill up extremely fast!

# Digital Learning

For digital learners/students they will still need to wake up for when class starts at 7:10. Log into the corresponding class on your schedule to join a live stream with your teacher. This will count as attendance, and during this time, teachers will give assignments and lessons. During the call, students should be in uniform and have their camera and microphone on. Reminder that most teachers will be using Microsoft Teams to communicate with you!

# Clubs

Our clubs can be found on our website under "Student Life". There you can find our already existing clubs. For example, Battle of the Books, Interact Club, Mind Matters, TSA, and of course, Knight Times, our newspaper club. You can read more about them here. If you're interested in starting your own club, Dr. Seabolt is in charge of clubs, so you can email him about your interest in starting a club, and there will be a form that you will need to fill out. Joining a club is a great way to fill up your free time and to participate in something that you love! It also looks great on college applications.

# Volunteering

Speaking of college applications, volunteer hours are very important. You may have heard of the Bright Futures Scholarship, which requires 100 volunteer hours. Our counselor Mrs. Fellows is great at providing us with many volunteer opportunities for you guys to participate in. There will be a list on our website whenever more volunteer services are available, so you can keep an eye on that. You can also go and find your own volunteer opportunities in our community! When volunteering, you will need to fill our a community service sheet to keep track of your hours, which you can also find on our website [https://www.osceolaschools.net/domain/859](https://www.osceolaschools.net/domain/859).

# Tips

To end off this article, I will offer you guys some tips that will assist you in this school year. You might have already heard this, but DO NOT PROCRASTINATE. Trust me, it will bite you in your back. The due dates are closer than they appear. The longer you put off something, the less motivation you will have to do it. On top of that, the work eventually piles up for each class, which is why it's best to get it done as soon as possible (and you will have more free time). Another piece of advice is to always check Canvas. Canvas is where every single one of your assignments are at. You can use either the list or calendar view to see your upcoming assignments and due dates. Always check this to plan out when you will do which assignment and to keep track of those due dates. Also, make sure to always check Outlook and Microsoft Teams, especially if you're doing digital learning. This is how teachers will communicate with you if there are any problems or updates. If you have any questions, you can also email the teacher. Speaking of teachers, our teachers are amazing. If you're having any trouble, let them know and they will walk you through it! They are here to help you succeed.

# Reminders

- Always charge your laptop overnight, the battery life is able to last the whole day, but always bring your charger in case.
- Keep practicing social distancing.
- Masks are always required on campus! (Only to be taken off when actively eating and drinking)
- Never give up!
- Be happy and stay safe

Have a great first week of school! I believe in you! Wishing you guys an amazing school year :)
