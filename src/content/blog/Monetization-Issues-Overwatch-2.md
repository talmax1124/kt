Blizzard, the game company behind Overwatch 2, has been widely criticized for its new monetization system. Overwatch 2 is a free to play game and requires a monetization system to produce profit. With the game’s inflated prices on cosmetics and inability to earn the game’s currency through play (Overwatch coins); many people have boycotted spending money on in-game cosmetics.

#### What is Overwatch?

Overwatch 2 is a first-person shooter (FPS), developed by Blizzard Entertainment. There are three set character roles: Damage, Support, and Tank. Damage heroes seek out, engage, and obliterate the enemy with wide-ranging tools, abilities, and play styles. Fearsome but fragile, these heroes require backup to survive. Support heroes empower their allies by healing, shielding, boosting damage, and disabling foes. As a support, you are the backbone of your team’s survival. Tank heroes soak up damage and shatter fortified positions, like closely grouped enemies and narrow chokepoints. If you are a tank, you lead the charge. 

The gameplay consists of five game modes:

* Assault
* Push
* Control
* Escort
* Hybrid

#### How the System Works

The original Overwatch used loot boxes as a source of income, which players could either buy or earn through playing. Overwatch 2 switched to battle passes where you steadily gain cosmetics by leveling up. The battle pass does cost money; however, some cosmetics are free in the battle pass. Buying the battle pass was also used as an incentive to be able to play their new character, called Kiriko. 

There is also an in-game shop where you can directly buy cosmetics. You can get Overwatch Coins, the game's real-money currency, by doing weekly challenges. Doing all 11 challenges every week will get you a total of 60 Overwatch Coins. That is the equivalent of $0.60. Yes, 60 US cents. The battle pass is $10, and many skins are $20. It has become extremely difficult to buy anything for free by just playing the game.

The bundles, where you can get assorted items with one purchase, becomes a problem when these items are not individually sold. If you wanted one item from the bundle, you would be forced to buy everything else in the bundle as well. Blizzard has since announced that items in a bundle will be able to be bought separately due to fan outcry; however, this change has not been implemented yet. 

The inflated prices of the in-game cosmetics are noticeable, skins that were previously available to be bought for free in Overwatch 1 with Overwatch coins are now selling for $20.

A controversial example of inflated prices is the in-game item called the Pachimari Charm, which costs more money than its real-life counterpart on Blizzard’s gear shop website. The real-life charm is $5 and the charm in Overwatch 2 is 700 overwatch coins, which is equivalent to $7.
