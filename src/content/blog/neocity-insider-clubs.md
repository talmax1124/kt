This weeks featured club is National Honor Society, led by Christian Cardona and Ms. Jasmine. NHS is an invite only club, open to 10th through 12th graders. They have hosted several events around our school, such as the 2020 and 2021 Cangineering food drives!

A few words from their club president depicting the club follow:

<!--StartFragment-->

> "The National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) officially established NHS in 1921. Though many local and regional honor societies existed prior to 1921, no nationwide organization had been founded. Under the leadership of Dr. Edward Rynearson, principal of the Fifth Avenue High School in Pittsburgh, the organization grew from the original Alpha Chapter at the Fifth Avenue School to more than 1,000 chapters by 1930.
>
> Today National Honor Society (NHS) elevates a school’s commitment to the values of scholarship, service, leadership, and character. These four pillars have been associated with membership in the organization since its inception in 1921.  The NeoCity chapter of NHS plans, organizes, and executes service projects both within the school and out in the community.  NHS works to plan student events but also focuses strongly on community service projects that give back and help fulfill the needs of groups surrounding our school.  NHS members work to serve their community and those around them not only by actively seeking to help wherever help is needed but also by always bringing forth the best that the four pillars have to offer. "
