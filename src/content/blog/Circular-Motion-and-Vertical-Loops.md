An Introduction





Unit 3 of the AP Physics 1
curriculum covers circular motion. In this unit, students taking the course are
expected to learn and understand the characteristics of an object moving in a
circular path. This article is a surface-level introduction to the topic,
focusing only on the vertical path of circular motion. 





 





Centripetal
Force





The centripetal force (Fc)
is the force that acts on an object moving in a circular path and is always
directed towards the path’s center. The magnitude of this force is dependent on
the object’s mass, velocity, and the radius of the path traveled. Centripetal
force is required to keep objects moving in a circular path due to its
relationship with inertia. As stated in Newton’s First Law of Motion, an object
in motion will continue its course of motion, unless acted upon by an outside
force. Centripetal force does just that by overcoming the object’s linear path,
pulling it inwards and creating a circle. 





 





The
Equation





Newton’s second law of
motion, F = ma, is a universal equation that is the blueprint for solving
almost every physics problem. F represents the force, m represents [the mass]()[\[DB1\]](#_msocom_1) ,
and a represents [the
acceleration]()[\[DB2\]](#_msocom_2) .
In the context of circular motion, this equation gets turned into , with Fc
representing centripetal force, v representing the velocity of the object, and
r representing the radius of the object’s circular path. In relation to the whole
formula, the centripetal force is proportional to the mass of its squared
velocity; as one increases in magnitude, the others do as well. This is due to mass
and velocity being numerators of the equation instead of denominators, like the
radius. The radius being a denominator causes its relationship with the
centripetal force to be inversely proportional. As one increases, the other
decreases, and vice versa. 





 





Free
Body Diagram





A free body diagram (FBD)
is a portrayal of the forces that act on an object. In this diagram, the object’s
center of mass is represented as a black circle, and the forces acting on it are
represented as arrows that stem from the black circle, pointing in their
respective directions. Here’s an example of the free body diagram of an object
attached to a string moving in circular motion:









The velocity of the object, v, is tangential
to the circular path, pointing in the direction of the object’s circular
motion. This is known as
tangential velocity. Tangential velocity is the velocity of an object moving in
a circular path in a direction tangent to the circle. It is perpendicular to
the centripetal force and is constant for an object moving in a circular path
at a constant speed. 





 





T represents the tension force that
pulls the object to the center, and mg is the force due to gravity, or the
weight, that acts on the object. These two forces act towards the center of the
object’s circular path, making them positive forces. 





 





Conversely, if the object was at the
bottom of its circular path, the tension force would still act towards the
center, while the force due to gravity would point away from it, making the
force negative. This is because gravity always pulls down on an object. The FBD
of this situation would look like this:





 









The tension and gravitational forces are
equal in magnitude (indicated by the arrow lengths) because the object hasn’t
broken away from its circular path. Essentially, the string creates an equal
and opposite tension force in reaction to gravity, keeping the object in
circular motion. 





 





Real Life Application: Roller Coaster





The FBDs provided can be translated
in other areas of life as well. Case in point, roller coasters. Roller coasters
are abundant with twists, turns, and most importantly, vertical loops. A
vertical loop is a circular path that facilitates the application of forces on
a roller coaster car. 





 





First, the car enters the loop, experiencing
the centripetal force that keeps it in a circular path. As the car approaches
the top of the loop, it begins to slow down due to the gravitational force that
acts on it. 









 





Then, at the top of the loop, there
is a temporary feeling of weightlessness that all riders experience. At this
point, the car is moving at such a speed that a centripetal force greater than
the force due to gravity is created, causing the car to accelerate upwards. Despite
the normal force (FN)1 and gravitational force pointing in the same
direction, the car does not fall. The only way for the car to fall would be if
it lost speed. 









 





After this, the car proceeds through
the rest of the loop. The car accelerates downwards, adding to the downwards
force of gravity and consequently makes the riders feel heavier once
they’ve reached the bottom of the loop.





 





 









Conclusion





Circular motion is a topic that
requires a lot of conceptualization and real-world comprehension. By making
connection between Newton’s laws of motion and circular motion along with understanding
the relationship of certain variables in equations, real world scenarios can be
seen through a physicists’ lens. Although aspects like friction and air
resistance, aren’t present in this article, readers can acquire a broader
perspective of life and how physics is applied to it. 





 





 





1: Force normal, or the normal force,
is a force perpendicular to the surface and is an example of Newton’s third law
of motion that states every action has an equal but opposite reaction. Knowing
this is essential to this real-world application because FN prevents objects from
phasing through whatever surfaces they are on.
